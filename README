You have to create an MySQL Database + a config.inc File to use this Software!
config.inc:
<?php
 
$hostname = 'localhost';        // Your MySQL hostname.
$dbname   = '<DATABASE_NAME'; 	// Your database name.
$username = '<DB_USER';         // Your database username.
$password = '<DB_PASSWORD>';    // Your database password.
 
// Let's connect to host
mysql_connect($hostname, $username, $password) or DIE('Connection to host failed! The Server may be down!');
// Select the database
mysql_select_db($dbname) or DIE('Database name is not available!');
 
?>
